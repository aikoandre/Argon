An advanced AI-powered roleplay platform designed to create deeply immersive, dynamic storytelling experiences with persistent memory, intelligent character behavior, and evolving narratives.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Development Status**: This project is currently under active development and is not yet ready for public use.

## üåü What is Argon?

Argon aims to solve the fundamental limitations of current AI roleplay experiences: short memory spans, inconsistent character behavior, and static storylines that don't evolve based on player choices.

### The Vision
- **Persistent Memory**: AI characters that truly remember past interactions and grow from them
- **Dynamic Storytelling**: Narratives that branch and evolve based on your decisions
- **Deep Character Consistency**: AI personalities that remain true to their defined traits while adapting to new situations
- **Rich World Building**: Comprehensive universe creation tools with interconnected lore and events

### Core Technologies
- **Multi-LLM Pipeline**: Advanced orchestration of multiple AI models for different aspects of the experience
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Semantic search through vast knowledge bases for contextual responses  
- **Vector Databases**: FAISS-powered similarity search for relevant information retrieval
- **Session Intelligence**: Dynamic tracking of facts, relationships, and story modifications
- **Narrative Event System**: Structured story progression with meaningful consequences

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

**Backend**: Python/FastAPI with SQLAlchemy ORM, FAISS vector search, and advanced LLM orchestration
**Frontend**: React/TypeScript with Vite for modern, responsive user interfaces  
**AI Integration**: DeepSeek models via OpenRouter, with Mistral embedding services
**Data Storage**: SQLite for relational data, FAISS for vector embeddings

The system processes each interaction through a sophisticated pipeline: query transformation, knowledge retrieval, contextual analysis, and intelligent response generation with embedded planning capabilities.

## üîÆ Development Goals

- **Enhanced AI Roleplay**: Create more engaging and consistent AI character interactions
- **Advanced Memory Systems**: Implement sophisticated long-term and session-based memory
- **Comprehensive World Building**: Provide tools for creating rich, interconnected universes
- **User Customization**: Allow deep personalization of AI behavior and story preferences
- **Modern UI/UX**: Develop an intuitive interface that makes complex features accessible
